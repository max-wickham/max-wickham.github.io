# Projects

## Fourth Year Masters Project

Title: "Deep Deconstructed Learning"
Experimenting with methods to deconstruct classical reinforcement learning algorithms into internal specialised sub-agents through natural divergence. 
[Project Code](https://github.com/max-wickham/FYPDeepDeconstructedLearning)

## Spice Style C++ Circuit Simulator

https://github.com/max-wickham/CircuitSimulator

A Circuit Simulator that takes a Spice Style circuit description as an input and calculates the voltage and current at each node in the circuit across a specified time period. Supported components include resistors, inductors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, voltage sources and current sources. Numerical methods are used to solve diodes and transistors. 

## ESP32 Indoor Hydroponics System

https://github.com/max-wickham/LivingLarder2

This is a personal project where I have been trying to build a completely automated indoor farming system that can grow produce within people's homes.

## Mips CPU

https://github.com/max-wickham/MipsCPU

A System-Verilog design for a CPU that supports the MIPS ISA. Has complete test coverage for all the implemented instructions.

## C Compiler

https://github.com/max-wickham/CCompiler

A MIPS to C compiler with support for numerical types, functions and pointers. Some support for structs included.

## Autonomous Rover

https://github.com/Group4RoverProject

An end-of-year group university project. Includes an image processing system implemented on an FPGA for obstacle avoidance.

## Python RSA Encryption Library built in C++

https://github.com/max-wickham/arbitraryprecision

This is a personal project that involved building a Python Library in C++ to implement RSA encryption. A completely custom-made big integer class is used to allow for support for 2048-bit encryption keys.
